1. preprocessing.py (Modified)

This script prepares your audio dataset for few-shot learning. 
Instead of a normal data split, it divides the actual sound classes into three separate groups: one for training (meta-train), 
one for validation (meta-validation), and one for final testing (meta-test). 
This is the foundation that allows us to train a model to recognize new types of sounds.

2. episodic_data_generator.py

This is your project's specialized data loader. 
During training, it creates an endless stream of mini-challenges called "episodes." 
Each episode gives the model a few examples of a few classes (the "few shots") and asks it to identify other examples. 
This process teaches the model how to learn from limited data.

3. train_fsl.py

This is the main training script. It trains your model to become a smart "embedding generator" rather than a simple classifier.
 Using the episodes, it learns to create a representative vector, or prototype, for any sound class from just a few examples. 
 Its output is the trained Keras model file, fsl_embedding_model.h5.

4. evaluate_fsl.py

This script acts as the final exam for your model. 
It takes the trained model and tests its performance on sound classes from the meta-test set, 
which the model has never seen before. By averaging the accuracy over hundreds of test episodes, 
it gives you the final, official score of how well your model can generalize.

5. convert_to_tflite.py

This is a utility script for deployment. Its single job is to take the trained Keras model (.h5) and convert it 
into the optimized and lightweight TensorFlow Lite (.tflite) format. This makes the model ready to be used on edge devices 
like a smartphone.

6. real_time_inference.py

This script was a non-interactive test to verify your application's logic. 
It used the .tflite model and a predictable dataset to ensure that the process of creating prototypes and 
classifying a new sound worked correctly, serving as a blueprint before moving to a live demo.

7. interactive_fsl.py

This is the final, live demonstration of the entire project. It uses your computer's microphone to let you teach 
the model new sounds that you define (e.g., "clapping," "whistling"). It then uses the learned prototypes to classify 
new sounds you make in real-time, proving the practical value of your system.
